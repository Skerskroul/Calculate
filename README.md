Calculate-MVVM-WPF


Hello reader.

I dont know how do good design this project. But i read more and more for project patterns. And now i want use pattern what i know in real project.


File MainWindow.xaml in this project its View. 
File MainWindow.xaml.cs its interface ViewModel which connect View and Model. 
MathModel.cs, ParseDate.cs, CalculateOperation.cs its a bussines layer(Model).
In future this struct modificate if need it.

12.07.2021 Cut file: ParseDate.cs, CalculateOperation.cs. Modificate Business layer.

           to improve my skills in programing.

# Calculate
Calculate-MVVM-WPF


Hello reader.

11.07.2021 I am junior programer. Program in this repositories i make in language C#. I use WPF and use pattern MVVM. 
I dont know how do good design this project. But i read more and more for project patterns. And now i want use pattern what i know in real project.


File MainWindow.xaml in this project its View. 
File MainWindow.xaml.cs its interface ViewModel which connect View and Model. 
MathModel.cs, ParseDate.cs, CalculateOperation.cs its a bussines layer(Model).
In future this struct modificate if need it.

12.07.2021 Cut file: ParseDate.cs, CalculateOperation.cs. Modificate Business layer.

13.07.2021 Today I refactore code. I cut 14 function. All this function i replace one function. I can cut more function but i have a  
           problem with pattern MVVM and my skills in programming. I need more time to understand how construct project in this pattern and 
           to improve my skills in programing.
           
14.07.2021 OMG. I remaked project struct. I watched a lot of video. And some(body;) video helpful, but i still did not understand.
           Finally i do this. Good "bad" commit.
           
15.07.2021 Commit stable version. Version can counted with operation + - * /. And can calc float number.

16.07.2021 Added all function for correct calculate. 
           
           
P.S. Sorry for my english.
